The **Mapas.zip** file contains the mapping of the species either on a map of Mexico with state or municipal division by time periods. Where the states or municipalities where the points of presence are located are highlighted. 
In the file **Anovas.zip** you can find the anovas or box and whisker plots of the species by bioclimatic layer where we can identify in each layer the range of temperature, precipitation and elevation values that each species supported for periods of time which helps us visually to estimate if our null hypothesis will be accepted or not, which tells us that there was significant change between some periods of time.
