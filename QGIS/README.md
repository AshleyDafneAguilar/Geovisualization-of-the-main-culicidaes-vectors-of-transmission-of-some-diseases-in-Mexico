This folder contains files and folders used in QGIS to carry out the project. 

The file **pointsamplingtool-0.5.4.zip** is used to install the pluting Point Sampling Tool, which is a function that allows us to know additional information at each point of presence, in this case the values of the bioclimatic layers.

The **files** with **.tif** extension are related to the bioclimatic layers used in the project.

The **dest23gw.shp** file is a layer that marks the state division of Mexico, while the **mun23gw.shp** file marks the municipal division. This information was downloaded from the geoportal CONABIO web page ([dest23gw](http://geoportal.conabio.gob.mx/metadatos/doc/html/dest23gw.html),  [mun23gw](http://geoportal.conabio.gob.mx/metadatos/doc/html/mun23gw.html))
