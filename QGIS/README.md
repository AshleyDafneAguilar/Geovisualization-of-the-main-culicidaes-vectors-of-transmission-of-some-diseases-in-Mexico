This folder contains files and folders used in QGIS to carry out the project. 

The file **pointsamplingtool-0.5.4.zip** is used to install the pluting Point Sampling Tool, which is a function that allows us to know additional information at each point of presence, in this case the values of the bioclimatic layers.
The file **Capas.zip** file contains the three bioclimatic layers used in the project.
Finally the folders [dest23gw](http://geoportal.conabio.gob.mx/metadatos/doc/html/dest23gw.html) and [mun23gw](http://geoportal.conabio.gob.mx/metadatos/doc/html/mun23gw.html) contain the files **dest23gw.shp** and **mun23gw.shp** respectively which were used to mark the division by states and by municipalities in the country of Mexico.
