This folder contains files and folders used in QGIS to carry out the project. 

The file **pointsamplingtool-0.5.4.zip** is used to install the pluting Point Sampling Tool, which is a function that allows us to know additional information at each point of presence, in this case the values of the bioclimatic layers.
The sixteen bioclimatic layers that were used to extract the information contained in the datasets from the *dataset_capas* folder are located in the **Capas** folder. Of the sixteen layers, only three were used to perform the annovae and hypothesis testing: *bio_01*, *bio_12* and *elevation*.
The **dest23gw.zip** file contains the file *dest23gw.shp* which is a layer that marks the state division of Mexico. A municipal division from the *mun23gw.shp* file contained in the .zip file download at [mun23gwp](http://geoportal.conabio.gob.mx/metadatos/doc/html/mun23gw.html) is also used.This information was downloaded from the geoportal CONABIO web page ([dest23gw](http://geoportal.conabio.gob.mx/metadatos/doc/html/dest23gw.html),  [mun23gw](http://geoportal.conabio.gob.mx/metadatos/doc/html/mun23gw.html))

Finally, the files **Estatal.qgz** and **Municipal.qgz** show how the selected species were mapped for each map of Mexico with state or municipal division respectively.
