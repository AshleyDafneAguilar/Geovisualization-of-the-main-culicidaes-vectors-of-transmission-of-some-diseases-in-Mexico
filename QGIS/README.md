This folder contains files and folders used in QGIS to carry out the project. 

The file pointsamplingtool-0.5.4.zip is used to install the pluting Point Sampling Tool, which is a function that allows us to know additional information at each point of presence, in this case the values of the bioclimatic layers.
The file Capas.zip contains eighteen bioclimatic layers, of which only the layers “bio_01, bio_12, elevation” were used for the project.
Finally the folders dest23gw and mun23gw contain the files dest23gw.shp and mun23gw.shp respectively which were used to mark the division by states and by municipalities in the country of Mexico.
